# Reference parser for TAO in TypeScript

This is a parser for the [TAO syntax grammar](https://www.tree-annotation.org/#grammar) implemented in TypeScript as a [Deno-style](https://deno.land/manual@v1.8.0/contributing/style_guide) module.

The implementation can be used as a reference for other parsers, in particular in programming languages similar to TypeScript.

# Interactive version

Interactive version of the parser in JavaScript can be tried at [tree-annotation.org](https://tree-annotation.org/parser.html).

# Testing

Testing depends on [Deno](https://deno.land).

```
sh test.sh
```
